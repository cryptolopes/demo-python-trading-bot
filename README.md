# Waves-Exchange trading bot (forked from SimpleBot)

It is a Python bot implementing a scalping trading strategy. It can work with any assets pair on the Waves DEX.

SimpleBot exploits small changes in currency prices: it buys at the mean price minus some step and sells at the mean price plus some step, in order to gain the bid/ask difference. It normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, in this case within 15 seconds.

The SimpleBot with initial parameters trade on Waves-BTC pair (Waves is an amount asset and BTC is a price_asset). The spread mean price is ```(best_bid + best_ask) / 2```. The price step is ```0.5%``` from mean price. The SimpleBot place the buy order at price ```meanprice * (1 - price_step)``` and the amount ```(BTC_balance / bid_price) - order_fee```. The sell order is placed at ```meanprice * (1 + price_step)``` and the amount equal to ```Waves_balance - order_fee```.
